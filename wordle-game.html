        <h2>How We Built This Game</h2>
        <div class="conversation">
            <p><strong>Human:</strong> Can you create a Wordle game? Again, split it into files: HTML UI, script, resources (dictionary) and CSS.</p>
            <p><strong>Assistant:</strong> Certainly! I'd be happy to create a Wordle game for you, split into separate files for HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and a dictionary resource. Let's break it down:</p>

            <p><strong>Human:</strong> Can you add an option for playing in Hebrew or Arabic?</p>
            <p><strong>Assistant:</strong> Certainly! Adding options for playing in Hebrew or Arabic is a great way to make the game more inclusive and multilingual. We'll need to modify our existing files and add some new resources to support these languages. Here's how we can do it:</p>

            <p><strong>Human:</strong> I got the word on the first try, but because it was a four letter word, the script didn't recognize my success. Maybe we need to add space?</p>
            <p><strong>Assistant:</strong> I apologize for that oversight. You're absolutely right - Hebrew and Arabic often have words that are shorter than 5 letters, and our current implementation doesn't account for this. We need to modify the game to handle words of varying lengths, up to 5 letters. Here's how we can adjust the script to accommodate this:</p>

            <p><strong>Human:</strong> I want to show colleagues how we built this game together. Add a transcript of our conversation to the bottom of the HTML. Include my prompts in full, and the few first lines of yours - without the actual files generated. Go easy on the tech stuff.</p>
            <p><strong>Assistant:</strong> Certainly! I'd be happy to add a transcript of our conversation to the HTML file. This will give your colleagues a nice overview of how we collaboratively built the game without overwhelming them with technical details. Here's how we can modify the HTML to include this transcript:</p>
