        me: are you familliar with the NYTimes connections game?
        Claude: 
        Yes, I'm familiar with the New York Times Connections game. It's a popular word puzzle game that was introduced by the New York Times in 2023 as part of their Games section. 

In Connections, players are presented with a grid of 16 words or phrases. The goal is to organize these words into four groups of four, where each group shares a common theme or connection. These connections can be based on various factors such as synonyms, categories, idioms, or other relationships.

The game is known for its increasing difficulty as you progress, with some connections being obvious and others requiring more lateral thinking. Players have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct groupings.

Would you like to know more about the game, or perhaps discuss strategies for playing it?

        me: create an html5 version of the game

        Claude: 
        I've created a simple HTML5 version of the Connections game. Here's a breakdown of its features:
        ....

        me: great. now break this into three files:
* and html file which explains the game and has the canvas embedded.
* a js file with the codes for the game (the html will call it)
* a resource file where I can edit the catagories
