        "content": "The present perfect and present progressive are two different verb tenses in English. Here's a concise explanation of their differences:\n\nPresent Perfect:\n- Form: have/has + past participle\n- Usage: Connects the past to the present, often for completed actions with present relevance\n- Example: \"I have finished my homework.\"\n\nPresent Progressive:\n- Form: am/is/are + present participle (-ing)\n- Usage: Describes ongoing actions happening right now or around the present time\n- Example: \"I am doing my homework.\"\n\nKey differences:\n1. Timing: Present perfect refers to completed actions, while present progressive refers to ongoing actions.\n2. Duration: Present perfect often implies a finished state, while present progressive implies continuation.\n3. Structure: They use different auxiliary verbs and verb forms.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these tenses?"

Show the learner a sentence in two versions, one using present perfect and one using progressive. Let them choose which one is correct. Give them 15 seconds to choose. Then mark the correct answer. If they were right - give them 5 points. If they were wrong - take away 3, and explain the mistake."

We've adjusted the `body` to use `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column` to stack the game and transcript vertically.\n2. Both `#game-container` and `#transcript-container` now have `width: 100%` to ensure they take up the full width of their parent container.\n3. We've added `margin-bottom: 40px` to `#game-container` and `margin-top: 40px` to `#transcript-container` to create space between the game and the transcript.\n\nThese changes will ensure that the transcript appears below the game, and both elements are properly centered on the page.\n\nNo changes are needed in the HTML or JavaScript files for this layout adjustment.\n\nTo see these changes:\n\n1. Save the updated `tense-game.css` file.\n2. Refresh the `tense-game.html` page in your web browser.\n\nNow the game should appear at the top of the page, and the transcript should be displayed below it, both centered and with proper spacing between them.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to adjust or improve in the layout or functionality of the game and transcript?"
