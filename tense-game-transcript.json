        "content": "The present perfect and present progressive are two different verb tenses in English. Here's a concise explanation of their differences:\n\nPresent Perfect:\n- Form: have/has + past participle\n- Usage: Connects the past to the present, often for completed actions with present relevance\n- Example: \"I have finished my homework.\"\n\nPresent Progressive:\n- Form: am/is/are + present participle (-ing)\n- Usage: Describes ongoing actions happening right now or around the present time\n- Example: \"I am doing my homework.\"\n\nKey differences:\n1. Timing: Present perfect refers to completed actions, while present progressive refers to ongoing actions.\n2. Duration: Present perfect often implies a finished state, while present progressive implies continuation.\n3. Structure: They use different auxiliary verbs and verb forms.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these tenses?"

Show the learner a sentence in two versions, one using present perfect and one using progressive. Let them choose which one is correct. Give them 15 seconds to choose. Then mark the correct answer. If they were right - give them 5 points. If they were wrong - take away 3, and explain the mistake."

I'll create a simple HTML5 game based on your description.\n\n[Assistant provides the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the game]\n\nThis structure makes the game more maintainable and expandable. You can easily add new sentences to the JSON file without touching the core game logic.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of the code in more detail or suggest any additional features?"
